0,"Transmutations Involving the Di-neutron in Condensed Matter | It has been recently revealed how a lattice bound proton, in an electrochemical cathode, can absorb a relativistic electron
yielding a neutron. There is no longer much doubt that the analogous electron capture by a deuteron, in condensed matter,

occasionally captured yielding neutron heavy nuclei. This is followed by beta decay and the respective isotonic products. We show
that, within the PdD matrix, these di-neutron reactions involve phonon enforced quantum tunneling. The di-neutron-phonon mech-
anism fully accounts for the following: (1) the evolved heat commensurate with 4He production, (2) the production of tritium when
small amounts of 1H are present, (3) the release of feeble neutrons, (4) the formation of Pr when Cs is present, (5) the ostensive
intermittent reproducibility and erratic (chaotic) heat out-puts, and (6) the seemingly major problem of obfuscating the Coulombic
repulsion issue. Indeed, the antics of the di-neutron can fully explain the important aspects of normal temperature LENR heat
effects and transmutations. Further, the di-neutron paradigm (mechanism) falls within the normal bounds of the Standard Model,
and it is without the necessity of exotic forms of matter.
Theoretical Study of the Transmutation Reactions | Transmutation reactions are studied from a theoretical point of view. An idea is proposed to explain the variations in the transmuta-
tion ability of different elements, especially the relative inertness of palladium compared to the other elements. Proposals are made
in order to verify experimentally this explanation and to enhance the transmutation signal.
Evidence for Nuclear Transmutations in Ni–H Electrolysis | We report an easily reproducible Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) electrolysis experiment on an Ni–H system. An elec-
trolytic cell with a Ni cathode and a Pt anode with an aqueous (H2O not D2O) solution of K2CO3 as electrolyte was used for the
experiment. A dc-power supply capable of supplying up to 5 A current was used to drive the electrolysis with the typical current
being around 4 A and the applied voltage about 100 V. After running the electrolysis for about two weeks with a daily run time of 8
h on an average, a part of the nickel electrode, which by this time had become black, was taken for elemental analysis using Energy
Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The EDS analysis showed that a whole host of new elements had appeared on the cathode such as:
K, Fe, Cu, O, Rh, Zr and Pb. The apparent concentration of the elements varied from just over a percent for K and Pb to about 10%
for Rh and 20% for Cu. The sample was then taken to a Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (ToF-SIMS) for isotopic
analysis. This analysis also showed that a set of new elements had appeared on the nickel wire which were: K, Si, Mg, Mn, Zn,
O & Rh. The Ni itself was found to have the following isotopes: 58Ni, 60Ni and 62Ni with isotope concentration ratios differing
significantly from the ratio found in naturally occurring Ni. It was clear that in the electrolyzed Ni the concentrations of 60Ni and
62Ni had gone down compared to the concentration of 58Ni. This is a clear indication that nuclear reactions had taken place during
electrolysis."
1,"Charged Particle Emissions and Surface Morphology of Pd/PdO:D and TiD Targets Under Electron Beam Excitation | We report charged particle emission from metal deuterides upon e-beam excitation of
their surface. Detection and identification was made using CR-39 plastic track detectors with Cu
and Al absorbers. Protons with primary energy 3 MeV and α-particles with energies Eα> 10 MeV
are observed.
Charged Particle Emission during Electron Beam Excitation of Deuterium Subsystem in Pd and Ti- Deuteride Targets | Energetic charged particle emissions accompanying deuterium desorption from
specially prepared Pd/PdO:Dx and TiDx targets in vacuum, stimulated by electron
beam (J ~ 0.6 mA/cm2, U = 30 keV) have been studied using a set of CR-39
plastic track detectors covered with various metal foil filters. It was found that the
electron bombardment of those targets is caused by statistically significant
emissions of DD-reaction product (3 MeV protons), as well as high energy alpha
particles (11-20 MeV). At the same time the Pd/PdO:Dx and the TiDx samples
show no sign of nuclear emissions during vacuum exposure without e-beam
stimulation. Extrapolation of both the DD-reaction cross section and the
enhancement factor (consistent with calculated screening potential Ue = 750 eV)
to very low deuteron energy allowed us to satisfactorily describe the detected DD-
reaction yield in Pd/PdO:Dx target, assuming “hot” deuteron (Ed ~ 3.0 eV)
generation under e-beam bombardment. This result strongly supports the
theoretical prediction [1,2] with regards to electron excitation of the D- subsystem
in Pd- deuterides
SEARCH FOR COHERENT DEUTERON FUSION BY BEAM AND ELECTROLYSIS EXPERIMENTS | Procedures and results of three kinds of experiments i.e., closed type D2O/Pd electrolysis,
electron beam irradiation and ion-beam bombardment on titanium-deuteride (TiDx) have been
introduced in this paper. In the electrolysis experiment, upper gas of the electrolysis cell was analyzed
using a Quadrupole Mass Analysis System (Q-MAS). Significant amount of helium-4 was detected
without neutron emission in several experiments and in one of these experiments, the amount of
helium-4 atom in the released gas from the palladium cathode was 8.1x1016 atoms. Under electron
beam irradiation to highly D-loaded palladium, anomalous spectra were taken in X-ray measurement.
In the experiments using deuteron beam and TiDx, responses which suggested 3D multi-body fusion
were taken and the reaction rate of which was increased compared to the D(d,p)T reaction rate, below
100 keV. This result may reflect the coherent effect of the solid state in the reactions. From the results
of the experiments using proton beam and TiDx, peaks which suggested 3D multi-body reaction were
detected with high reproducibility. Moreover, high energetic protons having 17-20 MeV emitted
kinetic energy which suggested H-D-D three-body coherent fusion were also detected."
2,"Heat Production and RF Detection during Cathodic Polarization of Palladium in 0.1 M LiOD | The study of the Fleischmann–Pons Effect (FPE), i.e. the production of excess power production during electrochemical loading
of deuterium in palladium (in the past labeled cold fusion) has had a notably multidisciplinary character, involving solid state and
nuclear physics, material science, electrochemistry and other fields. Correlations between the material status and the occurrence of
the effect as well as some changes in the electrochemical interface status have been observed. Although during the last two decades,
in several calorimetric experiments the effect was observed to be well above the measurement uncertainty, the mechanism producing
the excess power is not completely understood. So far, the lack of reproducibility has been responsible for the absence of a clear
explanation of the phenomenon based on experimental apparatus designed to enhance the spectrum of information required to
define the effect. Recently, In order to improve this aspect of this research, specific work has been carried out to investigate whether
the excess power was produced concurrently with the emission of Radio Frequency from the active cathode. Suitable probes
and triggering included in the RF experimental system revealed RF signal emission during electrochemical loading of palladium
samples, and a correlation between the heat production, in active samples, and RF signal emission was found. The preliminary
results highlight the importance of performing studies on the electrodynamic effects that may be involved in the phenomenon, and
the importance of the design of appropriate instruments designed to investigate unexplored regions of metal hydrogen systems.
Confirmation of heat generation and anomalous element caused by plasma electrolysis in the liquid | Plasma was formed on the electrode surface in a liquid electrolyte when a metal cathode
was polarized in high voltage electrolysis in the solution. During the plasma electrolysis large
amounts of heat are sometimes generated. The heat can exceed input substantially, in some cases
by up to 200 percent of input power. At the same time, anomalous elements are detected in the
electrolyte and on the electrode surface. Based on the heat and the product, we hypothesize a
nuclear reaction can be induced by photon activation on the cathode element.
Heat Production and Trial to Detect Nuclear Products from Palladium-Deuterium Electrolysis Cells Introduction 2. Electrochemical- CeJJs | A burst-like excess heat release, equivalent to 110% of the input electric power,
was clearly observed for the first time in our newly built open type electrolysis cell using
Pd/0.l MLiOD/Pt. After being precharged, the cell was driven to boiling three times the
last of which continued for about 16 hours to almost dryness. The burst occurred just
during the calm period about 6 hours after the first boiling. The temperature of the cell,
about 100 ml in volume, increased by 7.5 Kin 13 minutes. A palladium cathode, 2mm¢>
x 7.05mm, was a heat source, although the mechanism of the heat generation is still
uncertain. During the whole period of this run, however, the phenomenon took place
only once. Neither increase of neutron emission nor that of tritium concentration has
been detected. Mass analysis showed that any traces of D2 as well as 4He have not
remained in the Pd sample used. Detection of 'Yray emission as well as 3He and 4He in
off gas during or just after release of excess power should be yet to be pursued further."
3,"Nuclear Physics Approach Anomalous Phenomena in E<18 Ke V Hydrogen Ion Beam Implantation Experiments on Pd and Ti WANG Tieshan* PIAO Yubo** HAO Jifang* WANG Xuezhi** JIN Genming* and NIU Zhanqi** *Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences Lanzhou 730000, P.R. China **Department of Modern Physics of Lanzhou University Lanzhou 730000, P.R. China | Implantation experiments of very low energy (lKeV <E<18KeV ) hydrogen ions on hydrogen
loaded metals have been performed with high beam density (Jmax.~1.2 mNcm2) and weak beam
density (Jmin.~ 0.02 mNcm2). Palladium and titanium foils (plates) have been bombarded with proton
and deuteron beams in order to compare the atomic and nuclear interactions between different ion
beams. X ray and charged particles have been measured, and neutron and gamma doses were also
monitored during implanting experiments. An anomalous peak in X-spectra, which energy is about
four times of beam energy, has been observed during high beam density experiment. The peak moved
from about 40 KeV to 62 KeV and FWHM reduced rapidly, while the beam energy and intensity
increased. Another wide peak with over twice of the beam energy has been measured in experiment
with low beam density. This peak located between 16 and 30 KeV, and its peak position grew with the
growth of integrated implantation dose (implantation time). Some anomalous intensities of neutrons
correlated with a charged particle peak (3-4 MeV) have been also observed in deuteron-palladium
experiment. The highest neutron intensity reached about 8 X 104n/s, while the beam energy and
intensity was about 15 Ke V and 1.0 mA, respectively.
ANOMALOUS RADIATION INDUCED BY 1-300 KEV DEUTERON ION BEAM IMPLANTATION ON PALLADIUM AND TITANIUM * Abstract Introduction | Low energy (l-300keV) deuterium ion beam implantation experiment on Palladium
and titanium foil (plate) were preformed, in order to study the nuclear and atomic
interaction in solid. X-ray, Y ray, charged particle and neutron ware measured
simultaneously. A series of anomalous experimental phenomena ware observed. A clear
peak at 3.2MeVwas observed, when a pre-loading 1iDx was applied. This peak became
evidently, following the implantation dose. Therefore, it is considered as the alpha peak
from D-T secondary reaction. Its maximum ratio to D-D reaction reached 0.0015. This
ratio was much higher than prediction value based on the secondary reaction of D-D
fusion. Some unknown high energy counts located from 3.5MeVto 17MeVin charged
particle spectra has been observed for many times. Sometimes the counts concentrated
in limited area, which appeared like a peak but poor statistics. The phenomena were
dij]icult to be reproduced. In the X-ray spectra, there were many characteristic peaks
from Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Zr, Ru, Pd etc elements. The gamma radiation up to 30MeV
was measured with a HpGe detector. Comparing to background, the intensity of
foreground was a few orders higher. There was also a few counts distributed around
17MeVand 24MeV, which might be the gamma ray from D(d, Y )'He reactions.
Multifunctional Ion Beam Installation “HELIS” as a new instrument for advanced LENR research | The ion beam installation HELIS (P.N. Lebedev Physics Institute, Moscow, Russia) represents an
ion accelerator of light elements with atomic number in the range Z=1-54 with ion energies ranging from 0.5
to 50 keV operating at deuteron current densities up to 2 A/cm2 and intended to perform a wide spectrum of
physical experiments related to LENR."
